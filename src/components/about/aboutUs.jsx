      This app was created by Dan Bednar. It was inspired by his wonderful wife
      and favorite Licensed Massage Therapist, Michelle. After watching Michelle
      make notes on seemingly random notebooks and having no consistant way to
      get credit card payments for her clients, Dan knew there had to be a
      better way. He looked online and there was a lot of options for businesses
      and managers, but nothing for independant contractors or people running a
      side gig. At least, nothing affordable.

    <br />

      From there the idea was born. Dan is a software engineer and had the
      know-how. Fortunately for him he had easy access to multiple massage
      therapists - including one who worked at his office and could speak his
      &quot;techy&quot; language. With this kind of access to end users Dan was
      able to make sure what he was building was what was needed every step of
      the way.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />

      With the research done and requirements gathered it was quickly found that
      this idea would work for anyone who does work in a spa or beauty salon.

    <p>
      Dan&apos;s promise to you is simple. Provide a simple product that does
      what you without making you have to do 2-3 extra services just to pay this
      expense.
