    <p>Welcome to My Spa Assistant!</p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to give Massage Therapists, Hair Stylists, Manicurists and
      other independent spa employees a way to track their clients and take
      payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our promise to you is to be an aid, not something that requires an extra
      set of services to afford.
